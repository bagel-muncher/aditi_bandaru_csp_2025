                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3.1 and 3.4: </strong>I appreciated how they taught string concatenation.</li>
                    <li><strong>3.3 and 3.5: </strong>The way the math relationships and expressions and booleans were taught were very easy to understand. I could use the booleans in conditionals. I learned about import math when wanting to use the full value of "pi" when making the formula of a circle. I also learned about</li>
                    <li><strong>3.6 and 3.7: </strong>The way the lesson was structured and taught made it easy to understand how conditionals worked. I was able to apply what I learned to the assignments of other lessons</li>
                    <li><strong>3.8: </strong> I learned about loops. Looping the conditionals made it very convienient for running the code and not having to restart the code after one run.</li>

                <h3>Beyond Perfunctory</h3>
                <p>For my homework, I merged what I learned from previous lessons with what I learned in the current lesson when doing the popcorn hacks and homework. I wanted to make sure that I understood the basics of Python and could apply my basic knowledge to the homework. When I needed help, I read relevant articles on w3schools or asked questions on Google.</p>
