    <p>Hi! My name is Aditi Bandaru and I am a senior at Del Norte High School. Here are some more things about me:</p>
    <div class="about">
        <ul>
            <li>I love to read books. My favorite series is A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin. My favorite book in that series is <i>A Feast for Crows</i></li>
            <li>I love watching movies and TV shows. My favorite movie is How to Train Your Dragon. I have a lot of favorite TV shows, but my top three are Game of Thrones, Tokyo Vice, and Peaky Blinders. I'm currently watching House of Cards (because of AP Gov and election year)</li>
            <li>I love playing and listening to music. I've been playing the piano for more than 12 years and I played the violin for 6 years. I love listening to classical music and instrumental soundtracks (I'm not that big on mainstream music, but I do listen to it occassionally). My favorite classical piece is Danse Bachannale composed by Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns. Game of Thrones and How to Train Your Dragon are my favorite soundtracks.</li>
            <li>I love to travel. My family and I go on trips every other year. We've been visiting a lot of European countries and cities in the recent years. My favorite cities in Europe so far are London, England and Florence, Italy</li>
        </ul>
