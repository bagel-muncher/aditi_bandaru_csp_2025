For my group, I set up a Feedback form for people to scan and give comments about our project. We got several responses. For my feature, Justin suggested adding more to it, so that users could select multiple genre at once. His reasoning was that individual books can fall under more than one genre. When presenting my feature, I realized that I need to work a lot using computer science and coding terms. I tried to integrate it into my presentation, but I was a bit slow with it (it didn't really roll of my tongue).\n",

They can select a from the genres of nonfiction, historical fiction, suspense/thriller, fantasy, romance, action, classics, or mystery, and will be able to generate multiple random books.

JSON is used to store and transfer data while the \"jsonify\" method converts Python code into JSON.

    "<strong>Explanation:</strong> In the same initSavedBookRecs function, the data in the saved_bookrecs_data list is used to create new records in the database. This segment iterates over the saved_bookrecs_data list and uses the data to create new records in the SaveBookRec table. The list saved_bookrecs_data is accessed element by element, and for each tuple, a new SaveBookRec object is created and added to the database session. Iterating over the list and using its data to populate the database simplifies the process of initializing the database with predefined book records."

    "<p>I was kind of surprised by my score because I know there were more questions where I had doubts - namely the questions of binary. I learned about binary a while ago, but it got confusing and I forgot about it. I should've gotten more binary questions wrong, but I got some of them right because I guessed C and that was the right answer. Compared to the MCQ I took at the begginning of the trimester, this MCQ was much better because I was able to understand the questions better overall. The skill I missed the most was 1.D. </p>\n",
