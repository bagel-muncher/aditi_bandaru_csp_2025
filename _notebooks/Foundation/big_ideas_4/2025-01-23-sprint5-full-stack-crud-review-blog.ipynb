    "My individual feature is a random book generator where users get random suggestions for what to read next base don the genre they selected. When a user inputs a genre, the random suggestion they recieve is displayed with the book's author, title, short summary, and book cover image. I'm currently working on adding a sub-feature where users can add more books (as suggestions) into the random book generator so other users can get a book reccomendation from a bigger database. I haven't connected this \"adding book reccomendations\" feature to the main database and it has it's own table in backend. \n",
