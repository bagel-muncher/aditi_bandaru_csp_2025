    "# What I took away from the panel\n",
    "I really appreciated that a lot of the advice the panelists gave were not just applicable to AP CSP, but to real life. David and Edwin, especially, emphasized the important of organization and documentation. Seeig David's impressive flowchart made me realize how much more viable or realistic a progect appear when you map or layout all the aspects/parts your project has. Moving forward into Sprint 5, I will incorporate a clear checklist, burn down, and flowchart for my project, I clearly know what I want to do.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Another important takeaway from the panel was getting insight and advice on what to do in college. As a senior, I've finished my applications and am currently waiting for decisions to come out. While waiting, I keep wondering what I'm going to do in college, how I'm going to meet new people, and how to network. I'm honestly scared about networking becuase I'm pretty introverted and am nervous when in an area where I know now one. This anxiety, is something I working on overcoming, but the panelists gave some important insights on what to do. Networking is extremely important for beyong college when trying to achieve a stable and successful career. In college, I'll definitely join a couple of clubs and go to career fairs to make connections and increase my profile. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "I'm planning to go pre-med for my undergraduate and then go to medical school. Even if my desired path is not related to CS, the panelists some information about how to impress people, and get into internships and programs that I will carry with me into college. The first one was to create a portfolio of everything I've done in college (all the projects, research, etc). The second was to have extensive documentation on those projects, so that people and recruiters know my skills. The last, was making sure I have advanced technical skills besides just a GPA because recuiters prioritize that. "
