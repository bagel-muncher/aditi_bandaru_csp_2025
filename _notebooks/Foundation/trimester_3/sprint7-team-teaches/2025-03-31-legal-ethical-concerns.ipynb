    "It's Not Your IP when: if you buy a video game, a movie, or a book from a store, you own the physical copy but not the intellectual property rights. This means you can resell your personal copy (e.g., selling a used book or game), but you cannot make copies or distribute them, as that would violate copyright laws. You generally have the right to resell legally purchased physical goods (first-sale doctrine), but copying or distributing them without permission is a violation of IP rights."
