    "This isn't an exact solution because calculating the absolute shortest path considering all roads, traffic data, construction, accidents, and user preferences (e.g., avoid tolls) is computationally intense. The road network is huge, and real-time traffic is constantly changing. Heuristics like A* (A-star) algorithm allow for good enough solutions fast by estimating the best direction based on known data like road lengths and speed limits. Despite that, heuristics are still used because they trade a little bit of optimality for a lot of speed and practicality, especially when speed is critical, like during live navigation."
