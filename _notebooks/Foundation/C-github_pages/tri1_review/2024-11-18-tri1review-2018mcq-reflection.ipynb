    "I got a 53/66 on this practice MCQ. Considering that this was my first practice for the AP course, I was surprised by my score. I had no idea what the questions were like going into this so I just tried to common sense or logic to answer the questions. One thing I realized from this practice, is that I need to read the questions and look at the code/diagrams more carefully. I missed simple details which led me to the wrong answer, so I have to be more alert."
