    "Trimester 1 went by really fast. Usually I have a rocky start the school year with Tri 1, but this year Tri 1 went by very smoothly. I am very grateful to have been in an amazing and collaborative team in AP CSP Tri 1. I had a fun time working with my teammates, especially on our Flocker social media page.\n",
